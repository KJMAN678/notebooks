    "# Inductive bias in GCN: a spectral perspective\n",

    "__author: [Marc Lelarge](https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/), [code](https://github.com/dataflowr/notebooks/blob/master/graphs/GCN_inductivebias_spectral.ipynb), course: [dataflowr](https://dataflowr.github.io/website/)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) introduced by Kipf and Welling in their paper [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).\n",
    "The GCN layer is one of the simplest Graph Neural Network layer defined by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:gcn_layer} h_i^{(\\ell+1)} = \\frac{1}{d_i+1}h_i^{(\\ell)}W^{(\\ell)} + \\sum_{j\\sim i} \\frac{h_j^{(\\ell)}W^{(\\ell)}}{\\sqrt{(d_i+1)(d_j+1)}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $i\\sim j$ means that nodes $i$ and $j$ are neighbors in the graph $G$, $d_i$ and $d_j$ are the respective degrees of nodes $i$ and $j$ (i.e. their number of neighbors in the graph) and $h_i^{(\\ell)}$ is the embedding representation of node $i$ at layer $\\ell$ and $W^{(\\ell)}$ is a trainable weight matrix of shape `[size_input_feature, size_output_feature]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [inductive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias) of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs of given inputs that it has not encountered. For GCN, we argue that the inductive bias can be formulated as a simple spectral property of the algorithm: GCN acts as low-pass filters. This arguments follows from recent works [Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wu19e.html) by Wu, Souza, Zhang, Fifty, Yu, Weinberger and [Revisiting Graph Neural Networks: All We Have is Low-Pass Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09550) by NT and Maehara.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will study a very simple case and relate the inductive bias of GCN to the property of the Fiedler vector of the graph. We'll consider the more general setting in a subsequent post."

    "We consider undirected graphs $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices denoted by $i,j \\in [n]$. $i\\sim j$ means that nodes $i$ and $j$ are neighbors in $G$, i.e. $\\{i,j\\}\\in E$. We denote by $A$ its [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) and by $D$ the diagonal matrix of degrees. The vector of degrees is denoted by $d$ so that $d= A1$. The components of a vector $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are denoted $x_i$ but sometimes it is convenient to see the vector $x$ as a function from $V$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ and use the notation $x(i)$ instead of $x_i$."

    "where the minimum is taken over vector $y$ such that $\\sum_i d_i y_i =0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if $y^*$ is a vector achieving the minimum then we get the Fiedler vector (up to a sign) by $U_2 =  \\frac{D^{1/2}y^*}{\\|D^{1/2}y^*\\|}$. In particular, we see that the sign of the elements of $U_2$ are the same as the elements of $y^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an intuition about \\eqref{eq:minlambda}, consider the same minimization but with the constraint that $y(i) \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ with the meaning that if $y(i)=1$, then node $i$ is in community $0$ and if $y(i)=-1$ then node $i$ is in community $1$. In this case, we see that the numerator $\\sum_{i\\sim j}\\left(y(i)-y(j)\\right)^2$ is the number of edges between the two communities multiplied by 4 and the denominator $\\sum_i d_i y(i)^2$ is twice the total number of edges in the graph. Hence the minimization problem is now a combinatorial problem asking for a graph partition $(P_1,P_2)$ of the graph under the constraint that $\\sum_{i\\in P_1}d_i= \\sum_{j\\in P_2} d_j$. This last condition is simply saying that the number of edges in the graph induced by $G$ on $P_1$ should be the same as the number of edges in the graph induced by $G$ on $P_2$ (note that this condition might not have a solution). Hence the minimization problem defining $y^*$ in \\eqref{eq:minlambda} can be seen as a relaxation of this [bisection problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_partition#Spectral_partitioning_and_spectral_bisection). We can then expect the Fiedler vector to be close to $y^*$ at least the signs of its elements which would explain that the partition obtained thanks to the Fiedler vector is balanced and with a small cut, corresponding exactly to our goal here.\n",
