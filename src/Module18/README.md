# Diffusion models

## Course
- [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://dataflowr.github.io/website/modules/18a-diffusion/)

## MNIST

The training of this notebook on colab takes approximately 20 minutes.

- [ddpm\_nano\_empty.ipynb](https://github.com/dataflowr/notebooks/blob/master/Module18/ddpm_nano_empty.ipynb) is the notebook where you code the DDPM algorithm (a simple UNet is provided for the denoising network), its training and the sampling.  Here is the corresponding solution: [ddpm\_nano\_sol.ipynb](https://github.com/dataflowr/notebooks/blob/master/Module18/ddpm_nano_sol.ipynb)


## CIFAR10

The training of this notebook on colab takes approximately 20 minutes (so do not expect high-quality pictures!). Still, after finetuning on specific classes, we see that the model learns features of the class.
